       "In 2025, several AI agent frameworks have emerged, each offering unique capabilities for developing intelligent, autonomous systems. LangChain is a prominent open-source framework that enables developers to build applications powered by large language models (LLMs). Its modular design supports integration with various LLMs, prompt templates, agent modules for task automation, memory systems for context retention, and dynamic retrieval components for real-time data access. This versatility makes LangChain suitable for applications such as conversational agents, document analysis, and code generation.

       "Another notable framework is LangGraph, an extension of LangChain that focuses on creating stateful, graph-based agent systems. It employs a graph-based approach to define workflows of prompts and agent interactions, offering explicit control over information flow and enabling branching and debugging of complex agent behaviors. LangGraph is particularly effective for applications requiring long-term context maintenance and potential human intervention, such as complex customer service flows and guided decision-making systems.
