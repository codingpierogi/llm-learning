**Companies Not Selected for Investment:**

1. **Perplexity AI**
   - **Reason for Not Selecting**: Despite its strong position in AI-driven search engines and impressive funding, Perplexity AI remains private, which adds a layer of risk for immediate investment. Its future potential is attractive but contingent on a future IPO.

2. **FlutterFlow**
   - **Reason for Not Selecting**: While there is strong confidence in the low-code development market, the space is becoming increasingly competitive, and the company's relatively narrower focus may not yield the substantial growth desired for high returns.

3. **Cohere**
   - **Reason for Not Selecting**: Although Cohere boasts a high valuation and strong investor support in the AI language model domain, it faces intense competition from tech giants which could impact its long-term profitability.

4. **Beehiiv**
   - **Reason for Not Selecting**: The newsletter platform market is robust, but Beehiiv's recent emergence means it lacks the established market presence and revenue consistency that are crucial for minimizing investment risk.

5. **Photoroom**
   - **Reason for Not Selecting**: Despite growth potential in e-commerce solutions, Photoroom's market is highly specialized and might not deliver the broader-reaching growth seen in diversified tech-driven sectors.

6. **Supabase**
   - **Reason for Not Selecting**: Valued at $2 billion, Supabase offers open-source solutions appealing to developers; however, the limited direct monetization potential and high competition are considerable concerns.

7. **Otter**
   - **Reason for Not Selecting**: As a private company focusing on transcription and note-taking, Otter has a niche market appeal but lacks the scale and scope needed for aggressive growth appeals in comparison to healthcare tech.
